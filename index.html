<p>The razor variables are useful tools in the search for
<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry"><i>supersymmetry</i></a>, a proposed symmetry of space-time that implies
the existence of a new boson for every known fermion, and
vice versa, at hadron colliders. The purpose of this page is to describe the variables and
the general paradigm, provide code to calculate them for a variety of configurations,
and collect references to papers and experimental results using these variables. 

<h3>Description of razor variables</h3>
The razor kinematic variables are motivated by the generic process of the pair production of two
heavy supersymmetric particles (e.g., squarks or gluinos), each decaying to an
undetected particle (the stable, weakly interacting lightest
supersymmetric particle \(\chiz_1\)) plus visible particles. The \(\chiz_1\) escapes without detection, which leads to missing
transverse momentum \(\ptvecmiss\).</p>

<p>To calculate the canonical razor variables \(\MR\) and \(\Rtwo\), we first partition all the visible particles
in the event into two categories, or megajets. The momenta of these two megajets are used to compute \(\MR\) and \(\MRT\), defined as
\begin{align}
\MR & \equiv \sqrt{(|\vec{p}_{1}|+|\vec{p}_{2}|)^2 -({p}^{1}_z+{p}^{2}_z)^2};\\
\MRT & \equiv \sqrt{ \frac{\ETm(\pt^{1}+\pt^{2}) - \ptvecmiss
\cdot (\ptvec^{\,1}+\ptvec^{\,2}) }{2}};
\end{align}
where \(\vec{p}_{i}\), \(\ptvec^{\,i}\), and
\(p^{i}_z\) are the momentum, transverse momentum, and longitudinal
momentum of the \(i\)th megajet, respectively, and \(\ETm\) is the magnitude of
\(\ptvecmiss\).</p>

<p>\(\MRT\) quantifies the transverse momentum imbalance, while
\(\MR\) estimates the mass scale of new-physics particle
production in the event. The squared razor dimensionless ratio \(\Rtwo\) is defined as
\begin{equation}
\Rtwo \equiv \left(\frac{\MRT}{\MR}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
